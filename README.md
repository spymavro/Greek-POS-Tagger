# Greek-POS-Tagger

## Exercise Overview
This educational exercise features a Python script that processes a sample of grammatically (morphologically) tagged Greek text. The script performs part-of-speech tagging without the use of any external libraries, demonstrating a fundamental approach to text processing and analysis. It converts tagged tokens into structured data, performs statistical analysis on different parts of speech, and outputs results both in terms of frequency and alphabetical order. This not only shows text manipulation but also the practical application of basic Python in linguistic technology.

## Installation
To set up this project for use or development, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/spymavro/Greek-POS-Tagger.git
   cd Greek-POS-Tagger
2. **Install the required Python packages**:

- Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- It's recommended to create a virtual environment to keep dependencies required by different projects separate and to avoid conflicts:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. **Proceed with project setup and usage as required**:
### Explanation:
- **Step 1**: Cloning the repository is straightforward; make sure to replace `spymavro` with your actual GitHub username.
- **Step 2**: This step covers:
  - Checking for Python installation.
  - Setting up a virtual environment, which is optional but recommended.
  - Direct installation of each required Python package using `pip`.

## Usage
- Navigate to the cloned directory in your terminal and execute the Greek-POS-Tagger script by running:: 
  ```bash
  python pos_tagging.py 

**Note**: This command processes the embedded sample text and displays results from the part-of-speech analysis directly to your console.
